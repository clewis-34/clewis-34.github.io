            You're alright in my book, Mr. Eastwood...I'd like to buy you a drink. Hey, look, I don't want a drink. It was no big deal. (Marty is tapped on the back by the Gun Salesman. He's holding out a gun.) Young man, young man...I'd like you to have this brand new Colt Peacemaker and gun belt, free of charge! Free? (takes the gun and belt)(in a what's-wrong-with-you voice) Back to the future! (with conviction) Right. Let's get going. (he sets down his glass) Great. Gentlemen, excuse me, but my friend and I have to catch a train. Here's to ya, blacksmith. (He raises his glass in salute.)What the hell? (Suddenly there is a huge "boom" and Marty and Jennifer are thrown back. They land on the grass. A shiny train, with "ELB" written on the side, appears. Out of the cab window, Doc pops his head out.) Doc! Marty! (excited) Doc! Doc!Okay, that's enough. Now stop the microphone. I'm sorry fellas. I'm afraid you're just too darn loud. Next, please. Where's the next group, please? (Town Square) (Marty and Jennifer are sitting on a bench near the Clock Tower.) Re-elect Mayor Goldie Wilson. Progress is his middle name. I'm too loud. I can't believe it. I'm never gonna get a chance to play in front of anybody.(Marty, Marlene and Marty Jr. all take a slice. Marlene and Marty Jr. both have television/telephone goggles on.) Oh boy, oh boy Mom, you sure can hydrate a pizza. (Marty takes a bite.) Now I'm sorry I missed that whole thing. (Hallway) (o.s) Now I'm just worried about Jennifer. (Kitchen)(Road) (Tannen and his gang are riding fast to get into town.) Giddy up, hey, hoot! (Train Station) Ma'am.(Marty holds Jennifer. Cut to his point of view. We see the DeLorean get up to 88mph whilst travelling on the skyway, then just as they're about to pass a floating sign, the DeLorean breaks the time barrier. The skyway vanishes.) (Hill Valley – 1985) Did we make it? Are we back? (A jumbo jet just misses them.) Argh! We're back. (Doc flies the DeLorean down a street, lets the wheels down and lands, driving normally to a house - Jennifer's. It parks in her driveway. He and Marty get out, carrying Jennifer. Neither of them notice the wrecked car in the driveway. They put her on her porch swing.
