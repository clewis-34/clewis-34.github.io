               Okay, real mature guys. (He drops his books.) Okay, Biff, will you pick up my books? McFly. That's Strickland. Jesus, didn't that guy ever have hair? Shape up, man. You're a slacker. You wanna be a slacker for the rest of your life? No.So tell me, future boy, who's president of the United States in 1985? Ronald Reagan. Ronald Reagan? The actor? Then who's vice president, Jerry Lewis? (he grabs some papers and runs outside towards his workshop) I suppose Jane Wymann is the first lady. Whoa, wait, Doc. And Jack Benny is secretary of the Treasury. Ahhh!!! AHHH!! AHH! EMMETT, HELP! Hold on, Clara! Whoo! (into walkie-talkie) Doc! Catch it! (Doc nods and Marty sends the hoverboard flying toward him.) Mom? (o.s) Such a sweet girl. (Living Room) (Jennifer sees her future son sit down in front of the TV. A painting is on display.) Marty Jr.Put it off. (The picture vanishes) OK, I want channels 18, 24, 63, 109, 87 and the Weather Channel.Argh!!! (A car drives past, its drivers fire gunshots.) Strickland! (They hit Strickland's porch, destroying a few flower pots, and Marty ducks for cover. Strickland comes back with a gun and fires it.) Eat lead, slackers!Dammit, Doc, why did you have to tear up that letter? If only I had more time. Wait a minute, I got all the time I want I got a time machine, I'll just go back and warn him. 10 minutes oughta do it. Time-circuits on, flux-capacitor fluxing, engine running, alright. (the car dies) No, no no no no, c'mon c'mon. C'mon c'mon, here we go, this time. Please, please, c'mon. (the car starts. The alarm goes off and Marty floors it.) (Main Street) (Doc just manages to get the cables hooked up correctly as the Delorean comes rushing down the street. Just as he gets the cables together the lightening strikes and passes through the cable and he's thrown back.) Ahh. (In the Delorean)

You wanna be a slacker for the rest of your life? No. Marty Jr.OK Griff, I'll do it, I'll do it buddy, whatever you say. (Marty Jr. falls unconscious. Marty looks at his son.) Stay down and shut up! (Griff is being watched by everyone in the Cafe. He turns to the two cyclists, who have stopped.) Keep pedalling, you two! (Marty grabs his son's hat and puts it on. He then stands up and hops over the counter. Griff looks a bit surprised.) Now let's hear the right answer. (Marty pushes Griff.) Well! Since when did you become the physical type? (Train) (The whistle blows as the train finally leaves the station. The bearded man from last night is sitting next to another man directly behind Clara, who is sitting alone.) Yessir, that poor fella last night had the biggest case of broken heart I have ever seen! And when he said that he didn't know how he could live the rest of his life knowing how much hurt he'd caused that little girl? Well, I really felt for him. I did. Right here. (Saloon - Back Room) (Marty is crouched low as he looks out the window. Tannen now has Doc as a hostage.) bI don't know, but I'm gonna find out. (Doc's Workshop) (Doc is watching the video of 1985 Doc. Marty walks in and sees him.) My god, they found me. I don't know how but they found me. Run for it, Marty. My god, they found me. I don't know how but they found me. Run for it, Marty. Doc.Yeah well Biff, you're forgetting one thing. What the hell is that? (He points behind Biff. Biff looks, and Marty throws the matchbox tray at him. It hits the chair just about Biff's head. Marty runs off. Biff turns back and sees him go. He fires at Marty and misses.) You're dead, you little son of a bitch! (Biff presses a button which calls for security.) (Hallway)What? Doc! (Doc turns and sees Marty.) Argh! A ghost! OK, relax Doc, it's me, it's me, it's Marty!

You wanna be a slacker for the rest of your life? No. (Marty walks after Doc and notices bars on the windows.) I don't remember bars being on these windows. (Lyon Estates) (The DeLorean drives through them into the estate. A pack of stray dogs run across the road after the car passes. The DeLorean drives down the street and stops at Marty's house. Trash is everywhere and most of the houses on Marty's street are empty/boarded up/have got "For Sale" signs in the front gardens. Marty opens the door and gets out of the DeLorean.) If you need me, I'll be in my lab, dismantling this thing.If you need me, I'll be in my lab, dismantling this thing. Right. (Marty closes the door and Doc drives off. Marty goes to the side gate and tries to open it - but there's a padlock.) (surprised) What the hell? (Marty climbs over the gate.)I will repair it right away and have it for you tonight. Oh, tonight's the town festival. I wouldn't dream of having you work on my telescope during such an important event. You are...planning on attending, aren't you? Well, actually ma'am... Of course, the festival... (Marty gives Doc a look, but doesn't say anything.)Emmett! Hold on! Doc picks Clara up just in time. They are now safe on the hoverboard.) YES! (Marty watches as Doc and Clara, staring into each other's eyes, fly away from the Delorean. Marty slams the gull-wing door and get ready to travel back to the future. The Delorean hits 88 MPH and they shoot off into 1985. The locomotive, on fire, falls off the edge of the ravine.)

You wanna be a slacker for the rest of your life? No. (Doc's House) (Marty drives Doc home in the rain following the lightening strike. He hangs up the letter from the Doc in 1885 by the fireplace to dry.) (The Next Morning) (Doc's House) (Marty is asleep in the chair. His feet are propped up using the hoverboard. Doc is still asleep on the couch. The TV is all snowy but suddenly the service starts working.) (Marty comes out of the bathroom and he's dressed in a frilly pink western shirt and red-ish pants that look very un-authentic.) Yeah, I have Doc, but Clint Eastwood never wore anything like this. Clint who? That's right. You haven't heard of him yet. Marty, you have to wear the boots. You can't wear those futuristic things in 1885. You shouldn't even be wearing them in 1955. (Indicating his Nike's.) (Marty takes a shot and it's way off the mark.) Hey listen, can I try that again? Sure, go ahead. (Marty shoots several times and each time he hits his mark. The salesman is at a loss as Marty holds the gun back out to him.) Hey, just tell me one thing...where'd you learn to shoot like that?(Marty is off to the side of the dance floor eating some pie out of a tin plate. Seamus and Maggie run into him there.) Why, Mr. Eastwood. Nice to see ya. I see you got yourself some respectable clothes, lad. And a fine hat. Yeah, well, a couple other people didn't like the way the other one looked on me. Sure that one suits you Mr. Eastwood. Very good for you. Ahh...thanks. (he finishes off the pie and looks at the bottom of the tin plate which says 'Frisbee'.) Hey...Frisbee. Far out. (he grins as he sets the tin down and then walks away.)Good morning, Mr. Eastwood. Interest you in a new suit for a tomorrow? Ah, I'm...I'm fine. Thanks. (He turns and spots Doc. He heads over to him. Doc is smelling a flower that was given to him by Clara.) Doc. What are you doing? (stops sniffing) Oh, nothing...just out enjoying the morning air. It's really lovely here in the morning, don't you think?

I thought maybe she was a girlfriend of yours. Marty. My involvement in such a social relationship, here in 1885, the result is a disruption of the space-time continuum. As a scientist, I can never take that risk, certainly not after we've already been through. (A carriage pulls up outside and a man climbs out.) Emmett! Ho Emmett! bAnd this one's for my car! (He kicks Marty again. Marty watches Biff get into his car. Marty gets up, minus his hat (he just leaves it there) and tries to follow Biff, but Biff drives off.) (The Roof) (Marty heads for the high school roof by running up the stairs, where he sees Doc with the DeLorean.) Doc? Doc, I blew it. Biff nailed me, he took the book and he drove away with it in his car. It's my fault Doc, I should have gotten out of there sooner.

You wanna be a slacker for the rest of your life? No. Mom, is that you? There, there, now, just relax. You've been asleep for almost nine hours now. I had a horrible nightmare, dreamed I went back in time, it was terrible. Well, safe and sound, now, n good old 1955. 1955? (he jerks up in bed just as Loraine turns on the light.) You're my mo…you're my mo…. (She lifts it up like a blind to reveal the real window with next door shown through it.) (Closet) (Jennifer, still hiding in the closet, listens to them.) (o.s) Your father's biggest problem Marlene is that he loses all self control when someone calls him chicken. How many times have we heard it George? (Kitchen) (Blacksmith Shop) (Marty is changing into more suitable Western clothes. Doc is studying the photo of the tombstone with a magnifying glass.) "Shot in the back by Buford Tannen over a matter of 80 dollars!" September seventh! That's this Monday! Now I wish I'd paid him off!

Marty. My involvement in such a social relationship, here in 1885, the result is a disruption of the space-time continuum. As a scientist, I can never take that risk, certainly not after we've already been through.(Marty wanders around and spots another Election Van driving around.) Remember, fellas, the future is in your hands. If you believe in progress, re-elect Mayor Red Thomas, progress is his middle name. Mayor Red Thomas's progress platform means more jobs, better education, bigger civic improvements, and lower taxes. On election day, cast your vote for a proven leader, re-elect Mayor Red Thomas... (A man throws a newspaper away and Marty picks it up and sees the date as November 5th, 1955.) This has gotta be a dream. (He spots a coffee shop and goes in.)

All right, all right Needles, here's my card, scan it, I'm in. Thanks McFly. See you at the plant tomorrow.(Kitchen) Why isn't she home yet? I'm not sure where Jennifer is Mom. (He pours himself and his son some juice. Marlene has a Pepsi.) Should have been home hours ago, and I'm having a hard time keeping track of her these days. Marty Jr.Hey fruit, fruit please! (The fruit thing comes down.) Thank you. Aren't you and Jennifer getting along? Let me go! Sonny, we can do this the easy way or the hard way. (3-D hits Marty on the head and Marty passes out. As the screen fades to black we can hear “The easy way” quietly.) (Pleasure Paradise – 27th Floor) (Marty wakes up in a bed. He wakes up a bit and sees his mother Lorraine.)Now, now, Biff, now, I never noticed any blind spot before when I would drive it. (spots Marty) Hi, son. But, what are you blind McFly, it's there. How else do you explain that wreck out there? Now, Biff, um, can I assume that your insurance is gonna pay for the damage? My insurance, it's your car, your insurance should pay for it. Hey, I wanna know who's gonna pay for this? I spilled beer all over it when that car smashed into me. Who's gonna pay my cleaning bill? Uh?(Doc is watching the video of 1985 Doc. Marty walks in and sees him.) My god, they found me. I don't know how but they found me. Run for it, Marty. My god, they found me. I don't know how but they found me. Run for it, Marty. Doc. Oh, hi , Marty. I didn't hear you come in. Fascinating device, this video unit. Listen, Doc, you know there's something I haven't told you about the night we made that tape.Oh, then I wanna give her a call, I don't want her to worry about you. You can't, uh, that is, uh, nobody's home. Oh. Yet. Oh.
