            You're alright in my book, Mr. Eastwood...I'd like to buy you a drink. Hey, look, I don't want a drink. It was no big deal. (Marty is tapped on the back by the Gun Salesman. He's holding out a gun.) Young man, young man...I'd like you to have this brand new Colt Peacemaker and gun belt, free of charge! Free? (takes the gun and belt)(in a what's-wrong-with-you voice) Back to the future! (with conviction) Right. Let's get going. (he sets down his glass) Great. Gentlemen, excuse me, but my friend and I have to catch a train. Here's to ya, blacksmith. (He raises his glass in salute.)What the hell? (Suddenly there is a huge "boom" and Marty and Jennifer are thrown back. They land on the grass. A shiny train, with "ELB" written on the side, appears. Out of the cab window, Doc pops his head out.) Doc! Marty! (excited) Doc! Doc!Okay, that's enough. Now stop the microphone. I'm sorry fellas. I'm afraid you're just too darn loud. Next, please. Where's the next group, please? (Town Square) (Marty and Jennifer are sitting on a bench near the Clock Tower.) Re-elect Mayor Goldie Wilson. Progress is his middle name. I'm too loud. I can't believe it. I'm never gonna get a chance to play in front of anybody.(Marty, Marlene and Marty Jr. all take a slice. Marlene and Marty Jr. both have television/telephone goggles on.) Oh boy, oh boy Mom, you sure can hydrate a pizza. (Marty takes a bite.) Now I'm sorry I missed that whole thing. (Hallway) (o.s) Now I'm just worried about Jennifer. (Kitchen)(Road) (Tannen and his gang are riding fast to get into town.) Giddy up, hey, hoot! (Train Station) Ma'am.(Marty holds Jennifer. Cut to his point of view. We see the DeLorean get up to 88mph whilst travelling on the skyway, then just as they're about to pass a floating sign, the DeLorean breaks the time barrier. The skyway vanishes.) (Hill Valley – 1985) Did we make it? Are we back? (A jumbo jet just misses them.) Argh! We're back. (Doc flies the DeLorean down a street, lets the wheels down and lands, driving normally to a house - Jennifer's. It parks in her driveway. He and Marty get out, carrying Jennifer. Neither of them notice the wrecked car in the driveway. They put her on her porch swing.

                <p>(Marty is trying to start the Delorean while Doc pours some type of alcohol into the tank.) Bartender says that's the strongest stuff they got. Try it, Marty. (Marty tries to start the car, but it won't turn over.) Need more gas...So what's the deal? Grab her feet. (Marty does, and they put Jennifer down by the discarded laser discs.) OK, now what? In exactly 2 minutes, you go round the corner into the Café 80's.Ice water? (laughs) Water? You want water, you better go dunk your head in the horse trawl back there. (The old men laugh) In here... we pour whiskey. (He takes out a bottle of whiskey and pours a small glass. Marty stares at it. There is steam coming from the glass.) Excuse me. I'm trying to find a blacksmith. Hey McFly... thought I done told you never to come in... (Marty turns and we see a mean looking guy, who looks a little like Biff Tannen, with his gang behind him.)Well, Biff. Alright, punk, now… Whoa, whoa, Biff, what's that? (Marty runs out.) That's Calvin Klein, oh my god, he's a dream.Well, this is a radiation suit. Radiation suit, of course, cause all of the fall out from the atomic wars. This is truly amazing, a portable television studio. No wonder your president has to be an actor, he's gotta look good on television. whoa, this is it, this is the part coming up, Doc. No no no this sucker's electrical, but I need a nuclear reaction to generate the one point twenty-one gigawatts of electricity… What did I just say?How about a ride, Mister? (walks over to her) Jennifer, oh are you a sight for sore eyes. Let me look at you. Marty, you're acting like you haven't seen me in a week. I haven't. You OK, is everything all right?(Main Street) (Doc and Marty are setting up the Delorean for the trip back to 1985.) This Saturday night, mostly clear, with some scattered clouds. Lows in the upper forties. Are you sure about this storm? When could weathermen predict the weather, let alone the future.(os)Are you in there, Eastwood? (Marty looks up out the window which is on the other side of the room. Tannen is outside, yelling into the saloon.) It's eight o'clock, and I'm calling you out. (yelling out to Tannen) It's not 8:00 yet! It is by my watch! Let's settle this once and for all, runt. Or ain't you got the guts? (Marty pulls out the photo of the tombstone again. It clearly reads 'Here lies Clint Eastwood'. He gulps.) Listen. I'm not really feeling up to this today. So I'm gonna have to forfeit!I thought you crashed it into a manure truck. How do you know about that? (covering) My father told me about it. Your father? Before he died.I can't believe this window is still broken. (She changes it from an Eastern garden to a sunset to New York at night to a mountain.) Well, when the scene screen repairman called Daddy a chicken, Daddy threw him out of the house and now we can't get anybody to fix it. Look how worn out this thing is! (She lifts it up like a blind to reveal the real window with next door shown through it.) (Closet)Too bad I didn't bring my camera. (Suddenly there is a big flash of light near the clock as some people have their photo taken by a old-timey photographer. Doc and Marty look at each other with an idea.) (A few minutes later Marty and Doc are standing in front of the newly running clock.) Ready, gentlemen? (aside to Marty) The only problem is we'll never be able to show it to anybody.</p>
