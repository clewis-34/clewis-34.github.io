            <strong>Amanda DeOms:</strong> You're alright in my book, Mr. Eastwood...I'd like to buy you a drink. Hey, look, I don't want a drink. It was no big deal. (Marty is tapped on the back by the Gun Salesman. He's holding out a gun.) Young man, young man...I'd like you to have this brand new Colt Peacemaker and gun belt, free of charge! Free? (takes the gun and belt)(in a what's-wrong-with-you voice) Back to the future! (with conviction) Right. Let's get going. (he sets down his glass) Great. Gentlemen, excuse me, but my friend and I have to catch a train. Here's to ya, blacksmith. (He raises his glass in salute.)What the hell? (Suddenly there is a huge "boom" and Marty and Jennifer are thrown back. They land on the grass. A shiny train, with "ELB" written on the side, appears. Out of the cab window, Doc pops his head out.)
